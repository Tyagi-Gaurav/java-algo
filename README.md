| Algorithm | Description | Status |
| --------- | ----------- | ------ |
| Ring Buffer | A ring buffer, or circular queue, is a FIFO data structure of a fixed size N. It is useful for transferring data between asynchronous processes or for storing log files. When the buffer is empty, the consumer waits until data is deposited; when the buffer is full, the producer waits to deposit data. Develop an API for a RingBuffer and an implementation that uses an array representation (with circular wrap-around). | :heavy_check_mark: | 
| Closest Pair (1D) | Given an array a[] of N double values, finds a closest pair : two values whose difference is no greater than the the difference of any other pair (in absolute value). The running time of your program should be linearithmic in the worst case. | :heavy_check_mark: |
| Local minimum of an array | Given an array a[] of N distinct integers, finds a local minimum: an index `i` such that `a[i-1] < a[i] < a[i+1]`. Your program should use `~2lg N` compares in the worst case. | (x) |
| Nth Fibonacci number | Compute Nth fibonacci number | :heavy_check_mark: |
| Combinations | Given a string, print the number of combination of characters taken 'n' at a time | :heavy_check_mark: |
| Separating characters | How many ways to separate a string "abaccadd" in to  3 strings so that each of them contain same amount of "a"s | :heavy_check_mark: |
